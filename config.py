# DASH_APP_PRIVACY can be 'public', 'secret', or 'private'.
# If 'public', then the log in screen is displayed but _anyone_ with a valid
#       Plotly Enterprise account can access the app. Your server administrator controls who has plotly
#       accounts: it may be limited to accounts that they provision individually or it may be anyone
#       with access to your companies LDAP account.
# If 'private', then a log in screen is displayed and only the app creator (that is, the user account that
#       corresponds to the credentials below) and individual users or groups that the app creator shares
#       the app with can log in. As the app creator, you can share the app manually with other named
#       user accounts or LDAP groups through https://<your-plotly-account>/organize.
# If 'secret', then the app permissions are the same as in `private`: only the creator and the users
#       or groups that the creator shares the app with can log in. This option also exposes an additional
#       "secret link" that allows you to view the app without any log in screen.
#      This allows you to share the app with other viewers that don't have Plotly Enterprise accounts.
